# IntroductionDynamic Assessment of Microbial Ecology (DAME) is an open source platform that uses the R environment to perform microbial ecology data analyses. It is specifically designed to work directly with output files from [QIIME 1](http://qiime.org/) with as minimal file processing as possible.The current release (v0.1.3) assesses α-Diversity and β-Diversity measurements, and differential expression analyses of count data. DAME requires the .BIOM file from QIIME and a .CSV file containing the .BIOM sample labels and metadata (experimental grouping data) associated with each sample. This app utilizes the Shiny framework to allow dynamic and real-time interaction with virtually all aspects of the data workflow. Where possible, table and graphic outputs utilize [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) for a fully interactive experience.# Getting Started:DAME requires two files to operate:1. BIOM file - QIIME output file typically found in the folder (OTU) during otu picking method using either of the programs **(pick_open_reference_otus.py, pick_closed_reference_otus.py or pick_de_novo_otus.py)**.    * Use the OTU generated file that has taxonomy details (e.g. **otu_table_mc3_w_tax.biom**). DAME will fail to recognize OTU table without taxonomy details.    * BIOM files that are generated through other pipelines (which are in JSON format) must be converted to HDF5 format before loading into DAME.    * Convert from biom to txt:		biom convert –i table.biom –o otu_table.txt –to-tsv –header-key taxonomy    * Convert back to biom:						biom convert –i otu_table.txt –o new_ otu_table.biom –to-hdf5 –table-type=”OTU table"–process-obs-metadata taxonomy2. BIOM Metadata File - .CSV file containing a column with exact sample labels used in QIIME analysis and experimental groupings.     * It is recommended to re-purpose the original map file used in QIIME analysis.    * The current version of DAME does not recognize continuous data and will either remove continuous data or treat the data as classifiers.      * The number of sample IDs in the Metadata file does not have to match the number of sample IDs in the BIOM file.  DAME will subset matching sample IDs between the two files and use those as the imported data.3. TRE file (optional) - .TRE file, typically found in the same folder (OTU) from QIIME output.    * Currently, DAME only utilizes a TRE file for β-Diversity calculations (Weighted and Unweighted Unifrac, and DPCoA distances).
